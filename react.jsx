// REACT --jsx
//React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI) — mainly websites and web apps.
// It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
// React focuses on the 'view' aspect of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
// It enables developers to build reusable UI components, manage application state, and handle user interactions seamlessly.




// difference bt react and normal js
 //JS:
   // we select elements directly from the DOM using methods like document.getElementById or document
   // and manually update dom elements when data changes.

    //React:    
    // we create components & updates state

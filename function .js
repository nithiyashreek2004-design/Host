//oops oraganise the coding objects and blueprints core concepts of opps in js 



//class  blue print for crrating objects
//object  instance of class
//constructor special method to initialize onject
//method     function define inside a class
//inheritance mechanism to create a new class from an existing class using prototype
//protoytpe   object from which other object inherit properties 

//DOM is document object model represents the web page as a tree structure where each element become a node
//  js can change html elemnt content change css style add or remove elemnt or change handle events  
//tre like object model creted by broweser that represented html ememnts as nodes
//  js manipulate the dom wthst the user seees and to represent and respond t o user acitons ex cclick typing form typins nodes elements node
// .text node attribute node comment node 
// live vs snapshot method like getelementbyid (id)single element by id fast and direct
// getelemntbyclass name(class name)live html collectionof elements with the class name (reflect change )in many elements
//getelementbytagname=live html collectionof elements with  that tag
// query seclector first elemrent matching css selector
//prefer query selector /queryselectorall for css like selector and consistsncy
//use getelementbyid  when u konw the id performance tiny benefits.






















































//prototype  object from which oth objcts inherit properties

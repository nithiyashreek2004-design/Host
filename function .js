//oops oraganise the coding objects and blueprints core concepts of opps in js 



//class  blue print for crrating objects
//object  instance of class
//constructor special method to initialize onject
//method     function define inside a class
//inheritance mechanism to create a new class from an existing class using prototype
//protoytpe   object from which other object inherit properties 

//DOM is document object model represents the web page as a tree structure where each element become a node
//  js can change html elemnt content change css style add or remove elemnt or change handle events  
//tree like object model creted by broweser that represented html ememnts as nodes
//  js manipulate the dom wthst the user seees and to represent and respond t o user acitons ex cclick typing form typins nodes elements node
// .text node attribute node comment node 
// live vs snapshot method like getelementbyid (id)single element by id fast and direct
// getelemntbyclass name(class name)live html collectionof elements with the class name (reflect change )in many elements
//getelementbytagname=live html collectionof elements with  that tag
// query seclector first elemrent matching css selector
//prefer query selector /queryselectorall for css like selector and consistsncy
//use getelementbyid  when u konw the id performance tiny benefits.

// js events listener focus on specific actions
// error handling
// prevents application is crashing
//impoves user experences 
// helps debugging
// required in real world application (form ,api,payment)




//asynchronous js thread 
// js is single thread  excecution by defauld js run on main s therad
// one this mean it can onle one executed using single call stack this design was original intented for simple web browser 
//   allowing the singlr thread handle both ja execution ui rendering if a single th app perform along rungin cpu instensive task
//  like acomplex calci it blocks the main thread making the web page or server and resposive untill the twask is complete
//js allow muti therad to overcome limitation of s th mjs environment offer api that allow devop of load tak to separate parellel thread
// web works are browerser api that alloe u to run js in a background thread
// separarte from the main html page 
//use case idel for perfoming heavy computation ex image processing large data caci  
// communication works can acces dom diresctly comm bt the main theres and workes happen way mess passing, using 
// and onmess eventhandeler 
// isolation dat is copied via structured clone algorithem when sent bt therad
//  ensuring no cuncurency problem with shared memory 
//  tranferable object can be used for performanable optimization














































//prototype  object from which oth objcts inherit properties


//example of opps in js
//creating a class

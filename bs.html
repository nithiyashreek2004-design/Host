    js is used for creating dynamic and interactive web content.
    It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, 
    such as updating content in real-time, validating forms, creating animations, 
    and handling user events like clicks and keyboard input. JavaScript can be executed on the client side (in the browser)
    as well as on the server side (using environments like Node.js).
    It is a versatile language that works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the user experience on the web.
